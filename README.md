# Master's in Data Science Projects Repository

This repository is a structured archive of my projects and assignments completed during my Master's M1 in Data Science. Each directory corresponds to a specific course module and contains relevant notebooks, python scripts, and summaries.

## Directory Structure

- `Applied_Statistics`: Laboratory notebooks and Python solutions focused on statistical methods in data science.
- `AI_Logique_&_Contraintes`: Contains exams, corrected TPs and theory summaries.
- `Distributed_Systems_for_Massive_Data_Management`: Summaries and basic usage examples of systems like MongoDB, Hadoop, Redis, Docker.
- `Hands_on_NLP`: Practical notebooks covering various Natural Language Processing techniques and algorithms.
- `Hands_on_Scikit_Learn`: Laboratory notebooks exemplifying the usage of Scikit Learn for machine learning tasks.
- `History_AI`: A curated list of book recommendations exploring the field of Artificial Intelligence.
- `Information_Retrieval`: Laboratory notebooks and presentations done during the course of Information Retrieval, focused on NLP processing, Ranking Documents and similarity comparison.
- `TER`: Notebooks, Python files, Documentation and Research Papers used during the Travail Encadr√© de Recherche (TER) in Qatent about Information Retrieval on Patents.
- `Deep_Learning`: Practical Notebooks + Theory Presentation Slides
- `Large_Scale_Distributed_Data_Processing`: Continuation of course Distributed_Systems_for_Massive_Data_Management. Summaries and basic usage examples of systems like Spark, Streaming Spark, GraphX, ElasticSearch.
- `Machine_Learning_Algorithms`: Recommended Books + Notebooks + Handwritten Notes
- `Foundational_Principles_Machine_Learning`: Python files and notebooks detailing foundational machine learning principle such as:
  1. Linear Regression & Gradient Descent
  2. Classification: Binary (Perceptron (ReLu) + Logistic Regression) & Multiclassification (Perceptron (Softmax))
  3. Overfitting & Regularization: Lasso, Ridge and ElasticNet
  4. Feature Maps & PCA
- `NARLABS_Internship`: Reports and Notes written during the 3-Months long internship in Narlabs/NCHC in Hsinchu, Taiwan.

## Usage

Clone the repository to explore the materials:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Master_M1_Data_Science.git
```

Dive into each folder to find detailed notebooks and scripts related to each topic. The `History_AI` folder diverges by offering literature to broaden the understanding of AI's evolution and impact.
